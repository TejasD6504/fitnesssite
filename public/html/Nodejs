Here’s a simple, step-by-step guide to set up Node.js on your PC (Windows):

✅ How to Install Node.js on Windows PC
Step 1: Download Node.js

Go to the official Node.js website:
👉 https://nodejs.org

You will see two versions:

LTS (Recommended) → Stable version

Current → Latest features

Click LTS Download (Windows Installer .msi).

✅ Step 2: Install Node.js

After download, open the .msi file.

Click Next.

Accept the License Agreement → Next.

Choose the installation location (default is fine) → Next.

Keep all components selected → Next.

Click Install.

After installation, click Finish.

✅ Step 3: Verify Installation

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and type:

✔ Check Node version
node -v

✔ Check npm version
npm -v


If both show version numbers, Node.js is successfully installed!

✅ Step 4: Create Your First Node.js File

Create a folder → example: node-demo

Inside it, create a file: app.js

Add this code:

console.log("Hello Node.js!");


Open command prompt inside the folder and run:

node app.js


You should see:

Hello Node.js!

🎉 You have successfully set up Node.js!
